JSON file for access restrictions to Moodle resources by email address

The JSON file contains access restrictions to be copied into Moodle.
The ``group`` argument allows creating group-based restrictions. The benefit,
compared to a standard group-based restriction in Moodle, is that there is
no need to upload the group into Moodle, and students cannot see which group
they belong to.
